PIR Sensor'sWorking Principle
When the sensor is inactive, then the two slots sense the same amount of IR.The ambient amount radiates from the outdoors, walls or room,etc. When a human body or any animal passes by, then it intercepts the first slot of the PIR sensor.




PIR sensor detects a human being moving around within approximately 10m from the sensor. This is an average value, as the actual detection range is between 5m and 12m.PIR are fundamentally made of a pyro electric sensor, which can detect levels of infrared radiation.


When the sensor is idle, both slots detect the same amount of IR, the ambient amount radiated from the room or walls or outdoors. When a warm body like a human or animal passes by, it first intercepts one half of the PIR sensor, which causes a positive differential change between the two halves.
